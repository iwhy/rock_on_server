General Rules:
*Everything clickable should have a hover effect
*Try to make UI elements fit in; don't let them look too boxy or out-of-context
*Most views with items inside them will need a scroller if there are more items than fit the view. This includes stores, inventory, leaderboard, etc.

Universals:
*This is the stuff that's always in the upper left
*Include:
  Money
  # of Worker Invites left [when there are more than 0, this becomes a link/button]
  # of Trade Routes left [when there are more than 0, this becomes a link/button]
  XP & Level

Island:
*Island in the middle, taking up most of the screen
*Top left includes universals - money, worker invites, and xp/level
*Top right should show name of island owner (or the name of the island, if they have names; I'll ask about this)
*Bottom left has 'action links'; in this view, that'll be a (1) edit link and (2) link to multi-island map. Again, try to make it look clickable while keeping it contextual and interesting.
*Some objects on the island will be clickable; one object should take you to the plane store
*Include a leaderboard at the bottom. This will be to the right of the action links and stretch all the way to the right. This should take up most of the space at the bottom. The user should always be able to see a simple or condensed version of this that shows only a (1) miniaturized island, if this is available [if not, use the friend's facebook pic] and (2) the rank, which should start at #1 all the way to the right. The idea behind the condensed version is to keep it skinny (like 80px) and then have a clear way of expanding it to make it taller. The taller one should include friend pics, mini island pics if available, rank, friend name and either friend level or XP. You'll also need a button that condenses the view, and a link to invite more friends.

Island Editor: 
*Your island is in the middle, in nice visual context, taking up most of the screen
*Your inventory is arranged inside a tabbed bottom bar [one tab for inventory, one for buildings]
  Inventory will include (1) Items you've bought and can click directly on to place them in -- hovers should indicate this (2) Items that are available to buy from the plane store, which will include a price and buy button, and (3) Items that won't be available til you reach a certain level - these will include the level and look faded-out so the user knows they're unavailable
  Make sure items you've bought and items that are available look visually distinct, so the user can easily tell the difference!
  Make sure the user knows that the purchasable items are available today only 
  Play animation when the user buys something, then change it to look like a bought/usable item
*Your buildings are also arranged inside the tabbed bottom bar (two tabs total, see attached image)
  
  Note: Try to make the tabbed thing look as contextual as possible. Avoid boxiness as much as you can. Make sure that the inventory and buildings buttons look clickable, but it's better if they don't look geometric (e.g. they could be framed by flowers, wood, leaves hanging over, etc)
*Save button is big (think 150x65) and on the top right. Also include a Cancel button here
*Top left includes universals - money, worker invites, and xp/level
*Clicking on items already placed on the island should display a popup showing the 'reconfiguration fee' (cost of moving); if the user clicks ok, they'll be able to move the item

Multi-Island Map:
*This is a view, not a popup
*Top down view of your island and your friends' islands (side-scroller)
*Trade routes visible on the map
*Include 'empty' islands that link you to Facebook invitations or 'work for me' invites (i.e. this is an empty island, invite a friend to own it)
*Some objects on the map will be clickable; one object should take you to the dock store
*Bottom left should include an 'action link' to edit the multi-island map
*Include condensed leaderboard
*Clicking on a friend's island lets you invite them to work for you
  
Top-Down Editor:
*Works similarly to the island editor
*You'll need to include save and cancel buttons in the upper right, both of which lead to the multi-island map
*Inventory will come from the dock store and not the plane store, but otherwise the same things apply, except:
  No visible levels
  Perhaps different purchase animation?
  The bottom bar is no longer tabbed, since buildings aren't available for this view
*You'll see
*You'll probably want to keep the same sizings you've got for the Island Editor, but change the art

Avatar Customizer:
*Bazaar Town style customizer
  Layers are grouped into stuff like eyes, mouth, nose etc.
  User will select a group and then be able to select layers from within that group
  View will include a preview of the avatar
  View will include a way to edit the avatar name (if there is one)
  View will include a save button (and a cancel button, if we're not in first-time user mode)
  View will include any costs associated with creating the avatar (I don't think there are any, so probably nothing for this)
