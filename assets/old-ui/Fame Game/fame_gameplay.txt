I customize an avatar
I add application
I get a song in my song inbox
I listen to the song, evaluate
I find out I can go to the charts to pick songs to listen to
I continue getting songs in my inbox
I get some action points every time I heart a song
  # of action points changes based on some criteria
  Sometimes I get other things too, like special bonuses
    First time hearts get something
  Songs get put into rotation at (fake) radio stations, giving me action points
I start getting feedback
  Negative:
    "WKBR: Passed up your songs"
    "[Promoter image]: Not interested"
    "[Fan]: No purchase"
    "[Band]: Too tired to rehearse"
    "[Critic]: No review"
    "[Booker]: Not interested in your artists for yyy"
  Positive:
    "KQD: Put xxx into their rotation" +1 [frequency dependent on "nurture"]
    "[Promoter image]: Agreed to promote xxx" +2
    "[Fan]: Bought the song xxx" +1
    "[Fan]: Bought the album xxx" +3
    "xxx was hearted!" +2 +$5
    "Someone played xxx" +1 +$2
    "[Critic]: Reviewed xxx positively" +[variable]
    "[Booker]: Wants to book xxx for yyy" +[variable]
    "[Fan]: Wants an autograph" +4
    "[Fan]: Bought a poster" +$5
    "[xx]: Wants to help sell merch!"
I level up
  "You've reached a new level!"
  I get/unlock something, like:
    More radio stations
    Distribution in record stores
    Bigger venue access
    Additional worker [which automatically do something]
      PR (access to critics/reviews -- allows you to submit artists to reviewers [part of nurture])
      Advertising (spend $$ to advertise band, band goes into featured chart; this also unlocks featured sort)
      Receptionist?
      Artist (creates in-house merchandise)
      Street team
      Charts access
        Fast growing sort page
        New genre
        Friend preferences sort page
      Better office
      More rooms
      "Sends"
      More $$$
I'm doing well! I have lots of money. 
  Buy stuff
    Items [non-functioal]
    Rooms [non-functional]
  Buy more artists 
  Nurture artists 
    Buying energy drinks, espresso, pizza etc. [once/x hours]
    Buying "advertising" on featured chart [once/x hours]
    Buying "sends" [a single send to someone's songbox] [once/x hours]
  Buy clothing?
  Buy locations [e.g. new office, start from beginning?]
My bands are so cool. I want people to see them!
  Visit friends' offices and bands
  Send songs to friends
  Trading something?
  Friend rating system?
  Chart topping?
I don't sign in for a while...
  Offices/rooms get messy
  Artists stop earning you action points
  Feedback slows down, positive feedback goes down as a %
  Miss window of opportunity to do something
    E.g. bands signable for free
    Critics
