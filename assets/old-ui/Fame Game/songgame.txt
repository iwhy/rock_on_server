like a betting game:
the more people who like a song after you, the more points you get
(so pick the stuff you think is good)
"early discoverers" of the most popular songs
music authorities
subtract points for already-popular stuff
bands get to see which of their songs are most popular 
show people "long shot odds but gaining fast"

start out with 100 music dollars

Doing some weird insomniac thing where I WANT to sleep (sleep, dammit!) but instead of getting tired and drifting off and doing that thing that sleepy people do I'm thinking about how to make iframes pass variables to wrappers and stupid shit like that. I used to think about how nice it would be to finish all this nonsense and just go outside, walk around with an iced latte or something. Stop by the pet store, give pretend names to the fish. Try on a dress. Eat something besides low-carb wraps and Weight Watchers ice cream bars (I've lost 8 pounds). Every now and again I poke around on Facebook and check out friends' photos and, JEEZUS CRIMINY, you people need to stop uploading photos of yourselves having a great time EVERY WEEK so I be less embarrassed about my lack of real-life-itude.

I'm going to try sleeping now, for realz, and if I'm lucky the sheets on this broken futon I call a bed won't itch too much and I won't have spider bites when I wake up. Wooooooooo.

I'm still programming at 2:34 AM on a Friday night (Saturday morning)
